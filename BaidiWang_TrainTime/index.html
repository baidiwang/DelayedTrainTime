	 MTA might be a strange word for many people, but for New Yorkers, it’s not. Most New Yorkers commute between work and home every day by taking MTA Train. However, there’s a forever annoying issue of MTA Train--its delays.

 <p>To show the general trend of delayed time, I found data about average monthly delayed time of Line 1 and Line 2 during peak or off-peak period since 2015 on MTA official website. I collected them in excel and made a chart of them. The trend of delayed time of those two lines are very different from the final chart. Line 2 always had longer delayed time than Line 1, however, since Dec 2017, the delayed time of Line 2 declined continuously, especially during off-peak periods.

 <p>“I guess the reason to explain it is the construction,” said a MTA station agent whose working number is 16135. “The construction of Line 2 finished earlier than Line 1.”
